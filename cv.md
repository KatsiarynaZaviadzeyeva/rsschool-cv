### About me
My last job was related with interior design. In the process of doing projects, I got acquainted with HTML and CSS, became interested in this and began to deepen my knowledge. I like to learn something new and develop, so I decided to change my profession. I have a lot of desire, drive and enthusiasm to expand my knowledge and improve my skills in software development. I think that rs-school is a great opportunity to fulfill my aspirations and become a sought-after front-end developer
